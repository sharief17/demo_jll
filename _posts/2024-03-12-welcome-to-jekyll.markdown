Jekyll is a fantastic tool for building websites for several reasons:

1. Install Jekyll and Bundler using RubyGems: `gem install jekyll bundler`.
2. Create a new Jekyll site: `jekyll new my-site`.
3. Navigate to the newly created directory: `cd my-site`.
4. Serve your site locally: `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
